# Code Replications

The purpose of these assignments were to demonstrate my ability to write computer code to perform
econometric analysis. Questions and answers were given and the task
was to create code that generates the correct answer.

Data and functions can be found [here](https://github.com/samtragesser/Advanced-Econometrics-II/tree/main/data).

## Project Descriptions
### Replication 1: OLS estimate of lawyer salary using matrix algebra
### Replication 2: Monte Carlo simulation of retirement consumption
### Replication 3: Maximum likelihood estimation of Disneyland ride wait times
### Replication 4: Logit model of charitable donations
### Replication 5: Numerical optimatizations
### Replication 6: Parametric and non-parametric bootstrapped standard errors
### Replication 7: Structural equation model of Disneyland ride wait times
