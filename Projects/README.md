# Projects

The purpose of these assignments were to implement econometric analysis from start to finish.

Data and functions can be found [here](https://github.com/samtragesser/Advanced-Econometrics-II/tree/main/data).

## Project Descriptions

### Project 1: Downloading and Working with NLS Data
This project incorporates data from the National Longitudinal Survey with the primary goal to find a variable that will be explained using a multinomial logistic regression. The code script includes data import, cleaning, visualizations, summary statistics, and initial analysis.


### Project 2: Use Your NLSY Data to Estimate a Multinomial Logit Model
Using the same data as Project #1, estimation of a mulitnomial logit model. Code includes regression results, average marginal effects, and analysis.


### Project 3: Random Utility Model
Estimation of a random utility model (RUM) and latent class model using cell phone consumer survey data.

Results of this project were re-created from the following paper: Michael P. Keane and Nada Wasi, "Comparing Alternative Models of Heterogeneity in Consumer Choice Behavior," Journal of Applied Econometrics, Vol. 28, No. 6, 2013, pp. 1018-1045.

The data for the paper can be found at http://qed.econ.queensu.ca/jae/datasets/keane001/.
Dataset 3 was used for this code script.
