# Projects

The purpose of these assignments were to implement econometric analysis from start to finish.

Data and functions can be found [here](https://github.com/samtragesser/Advanced-Econometrics-II/tree/main/data).

## Project Descriptions

### Project 1: Downloading and Working with NLS Data
For this project you need to download data from the National Longitudinal Survey. 

Your primary goal is to find a variable that you would like to explain using a multinomial logistic regression.  Some examples occupation, industry, degree completion, college major, 2year/4year college enrollment. 

For some of the variables you might consider aggregating the outcomes to some extent. For example, rather than having 300 occupations, aggregate them to 3 or 4 broad categories.

Once you decide on the variable you will study, pick 3 or 4 variables you think could be used to explain the variables.

Import the data into matlab and perform any necessary data cleaning and summarize the data.

You need to produce a coherent write-up that includes:

1) A description of the outcome variables you are studying and anything you had to do to construct the outcome variable

2) A description of the explanatory variables

3) A discussion of the prominence of missing values for each of the variables and how you handled the missing values

4) Produce and discuss summary measures of the variables, tabulations, means, etc.
