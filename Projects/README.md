# Projects

The purpose of these assignments were to implement econometric analysis from start to finish.

Data and functions can be found [here](https://github.com/samtragesser/Advanced-Econometrics-II/tree/main/data).

## Project Descriptions

### Project 1: Downloading and Working with NLS Data
This project incorporates data from the National Longitudinal Survey with the primary goal to find a variable that will be explained using a multinomial logistic regression. The code script includes data import, cleaning, visualizations, summary statistics, and initial analysis.


### Project 2: Use Your NLSY Data to Estimate a Multinomial Logit Model
Using the multinomial outcome created in Project #1, estimation of a mulitnomial logit model. Code includes regression results, average marginal effects, and analysis.


### Project 3: Random Utility Model

For this project, you should consult the paper: Michael P. Keane and Nada Wasi, "Comparing Alternative Models of Heterogeneity in Consumer Choice Behavior," Journal of Applied Econometrics, Vol. 28, No. 6, 2013, pp. 1018-1045.

The data for this paper can be found at http://qed.econ.queensu.ca/jae/datasets/keane001/.

For this project you will analyze dataset 3.   

Table 4 in the paper Fiebig, Denzil G., et al. "The generalized multinomial logit model: accounting for scale and coefficient heterogeneity." Marketing Science 29.3 (2010): 393-421. gives a useful summary of each of the data sets.  You will have to consult these two papers to figure out exactly which consumer choice data set you are working with.

Once you have read in your assigned data and figured out how to interpret it for this project you must:

1) State clearly which choice problem you are studying and what variables are provided in the data to understand these choices.

2) Estimate a normal random utility model using all of the variables in the data (these estimates will be actually be in either of these papers, so you can confirm that you are doing it correctly). Report the preference parameter estimates and the standard errors.  Do all of the coefficients make sense? Discuss interesting findings on willingness to pay calculations

3) Estimate a latent class model with two latent classes.  Compare the AIC and BIC to the simple random utility model to see which fits the data better.  How do you interpret the different types of the preferences that you estimated?  Do they make economic sense. Discuss
