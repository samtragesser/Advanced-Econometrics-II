# Advanced-Econometrics-II

This repository includes projects and assignments completed in part of the curriculum of Cal Poly's Master's of Science in Quantitative Economics. Completed Winter 2022.

## Course Description
Economic models offer deep insight into economic behavior and outcomes. If we approach observed
data as the manifestation of the process governed by the economic model, then the maximum
likelihood estimator is a natural approach for studying a wide-range of econometric problems.
The main focus of this course is to learn about the maximum likelihood estimator, its properties,
implementation and applications. This class will heavily emphasize the computational methods
involved, with little attention paid to off-the-shelf implementations. Students will develop a broad
understanding of this very important estimation method and most importantly how to implement
this estimator to solve complex real-world problems and gain deeper insight into economic data.
